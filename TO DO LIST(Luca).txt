-Create and implement a player Health/damage system [Done/waiting]
 //Damage dealt by player should be a part of the GunStats SO.
 
-Implement the health system for enemies [Waiting]
 //Each enemy type should have their own SO with all their stats.
   /This will most likely require studying and altering Kris' Code.
