Things i will be working on,

-finish the bullet script[DONE] 11/04/24

-create a scriptable object for weapon stats [DONE] 18/04/24

-Create a test environment for "swapping" weapons [DONE] 18/04/24

- Learn about/implemented a system for adding and changing animations [DONE!!!] 25/04/24

- Add "magazine size" and a "reloading" system [Done]

 
-Create and implement a player Health/damage system
 //Damage should be a part of the GunStats SO.
 //Should health and move speed be stored in it's own SO (PlayerStats)?
 //Could everything just be stored in the playerStats SO?

-Implement the health system for enemies
 //Each enemy should have their own SO with all their stats.
   /This will most likely require studying and altering Kris' Code.
   /Alternatively just stick to only the health being SO'd since each enemy already has individual scripts.

-Think about making a dodge mechanic :D
 *I think it would be cool

-Decide wether to start making levels or sprites first...
 //Study up on 2D level design and tileset creation
