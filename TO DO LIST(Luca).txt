Things i will be working on,

-finish the bullet script[DONE] 4/11/24

-create a scriptable object for weapon stats [DONE] 
 //baked into the test enviroment task.

-Create a test environment for "swapping" weapons [DONE]

- Add "magazine size"
 //A simple incremental loop that references a "magazine size" 
   variable in the gun stats SO?. "Reload speed" will probably have to be added too.
   Review how the "fireRate" statment works and see if something similair can be done for 
   reloading.
 
-Create and implement a Health/damage system
 //Damage should be a part of the GunStats SO.
 //Health (+ move speed?) should be stored in a seperate SO (PlayerStats)?
 //Could everything just be stored in the playerStats SO??
 //Regardless of that enemy stats should definetly be their own SO...
