Hoi!

You've stumbled upon a 2D Rouge-Like that is heavily inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-franchise.

It should also be noted that this is a high-school project made by students. Therefore it's a bit presumptous to assume that this game will be continously maintained and/or even be subject to continued devlopment.

It should be further noted that if development does occur it will be uncommon, for we have lives to live and tests to study for.

We are mere students with inexperience in both game development and programming, so don't expect stellar performance either.
